### Projection of mortality from IS and CVD in Brazil

To estimate mortality from IS and CVD, we calculate central death rates mₓ,ₜ at each age x and year t by dividing observed deaths by the corresponding population exposures and then taking natural logarithms. We then decompose these logged rates using the Lee–Carter formulation: log mₓ,ₜ = aₓ + bₓ kₜ + εₓ,ₜ where aₓ represents the average log‐mortality at age x, bₓ captures the sensitivity of age-specific mortality to temporal changes, and kₜ is a single time-varying index summarizing overall mortality level. We center the log-rates by age to obtain aₓ and apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the residual matrix to extract the dominant age pattern bₓ and the corresponding time scores kₜ, enforcing Σₓ bₓ = 1 and Σₜ kₜ = 0 for identifiability.

We predict future mortality by treating the estimated kₜ series as a univariate time series, fitting an ARIMA model and projecting it h years ahead with 95% prediction intervals. In parallel, we forecast future exposures for each age group and sex by fitting exponential‐smoothing (ETS) models to the historical exposure series. Finally, we obtain age-, sex-, and disease-specific death projections by multiplying the forecasted central rates ŷₓ,ₜ₊ₕ by the corresponding ETS-predicted exposures, yielding point forecasts and lower/upper bounds for projected deaths
